# Code tour and architecture decisions

[Overview](../README.md) · [Concepts](02-CONCEPTS-AND-TRACES.md)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [package.json](../package.json) | Names the module format, Node requirement and local commands; private prevents npm publication. |
| [.github/workflows/check.yml](../.github/workflows/check.yml) | Runs the committed checks on GitHub. A workflow file is not evidence that a remote run succeeded. |
| [public/index.html](../public/index.html) | Semantic content, controls and explicit IDs. |
| [public/style.css](../public/style.css) | Presentation, focus indication and project-specific layout. |
| [tools/serve.mjs](../tools/serve.mjs) | Local preview infrastructure; only public/ is served. |
| [tools/check-site.mjs](../tools/check-site.mjs) | Checks referenced local assets exist, without pretending to judge usability. |
| [public/core.js](../public/core.js) | The main input/output rule; no DOM access. |
| [public/app.js](../public/app.js) | Browser events, parsing, rendering and visible errors. |
| [test/core.test.js](../test/core.test.js) | Independent boundary examples for the core contract. |

## Follow one path, not every file

Start at [public/core.js](../public/core.js) and locate `decide`. Use this trace as a map: Read nonblank minutes as a number → validate participant input → validate rule IDs and fields → filter matches in table order → choose first or null → render winner plus all matched IDs.

The tooling is intentionally separate from the product concept. You can study the local server or CI after the main rule is clear. Neither an HTTP preview server nor a workflow configuration should become a prerequisite for understanding an inline-block box or a small pure function.

## Decision: Make precedence visible in data

Rules are an ordered list, so first-match priority can be reviewed without reading a branching maze. Returning all matched IDs exposes overlap instead of hiding it. Reversing the list intentionally changes the winner for overlapping inputs; that is the contract, not an unstable accident.

**Review question:** What would need to change if priority were a numeric field instead of list order?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Separate no match from invalid input

Nine minutes is a valid number that simply qualifies for no activity. Missing minutes are not a valid participant record. Distinguishing these states produces helpful feedback and keeps malformed data from quietly looking like an ordinary business decision.

**Review question:** Why is Number("") a dangerous boundary shortcut here?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Use a small rule vocabulary

Rules contain level, min and label fields rather than executable strings. No eval or arbitrary predicate language is needed for four teaching cases. All rules are validated, including those that would not match the current participant, so a hidden malformed rule cannot survive merely because one sample bypasses it.

**Review question:** Which new requirement would justify extending the rule vocabulary?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Change boundaries

A small change should begin in the file that owns its meaning. Change domain rules in the core, wording and interaction in the browser adapter, and layout in the relevant CSS rule. For the static references, semantic information belongs in HTML before styling. For the Git reference, the staged snapshot boundary belongs in the helper rather than being guessed from editor state.

If a story crosses two files, say why. A new unit, weather option or UI station may require a contract, a control and tests to change together. That is a coherent feature boundary, not permission to rewrite unrelated parts of the project.

## Deliberate limits

Persistence and frameworks are explicit where used: M019 saves a namespaced local draft; M024–M025 introduce React. The remaining builds use plain JavaScript and local data. M025 saved definitions last for the current session only. The preview server is a local development aid, not a production hosting system. A browser screenshot is one observation, not proof of every device or assistive technology. Keep these limits visible when describing your own work.
